/* Recognition Database
 * The database contains an inverted index that stores for
 * each visual word in the vocabulary in which keyframes it has
 * been seen, and its weight in the keyframe. Therefore querying
 * the database can be done very efficiently by checking only
 * common visual words. New keyframes are inserted in the
 * database by the loop closer task (see Fig. 1), after the local
 * mapping has finished processing it.
 *
 * When the relocalisation or the loop detector query the
 * database, a similarity score is computed between all those
 * keyframes that share visual words with the query image.
 * Because there exists visual overlap between keyframes, there
 * will not exist a unique keyframe with a high score, rather
 * there will be several keyframes with high scores.
 *
 * we form covisibility groups which sum the
 * scores of all those keyframes that are directly connected in the
 * covisibility graph. The one with the highest individual score,
 * being the keyframe match. Instead of getting just the best match,
 * we get all those matches whose scores are higher than the 75% of
 * the best score.*/
